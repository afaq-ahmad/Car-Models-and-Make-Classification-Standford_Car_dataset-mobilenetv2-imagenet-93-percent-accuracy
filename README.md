### Setting the code:

1. Download the standford Car dataset from [https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html) and place the dataset in the training and testing folder in the datapreprocessing.


2. Run the data_preprocessing/data_preprocessing.ipynb code it will crop the car images in specific make directory.


3. Run the Car_classification.ipynb code and train the model, it will save the weights in models that can be use in the testing.
